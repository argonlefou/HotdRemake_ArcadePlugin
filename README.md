Arcade Plugin for "House Of The Dead : Remake" game on Windows  
This UNITY plugin will modify the game in order to make it as close as possible from the original game arcade version.
<br>
<br>

## Compatibility
So far the plugin has been tested with both initial (April 2022) and updated v1.1.3 (Jully 2022) versions of STEAM and GOG releases.  
<br>  

## Installation
Unzip the plugin content to the base directory of the game, where the file `The House of the Dead Remake.exe` is located.  
Please remove any other installed plugin (ex: old Mystery Wizard plugin for multiplayer with first versions of the game).  
<br>
## Configuration
Run the `ArcadeMod_Config.exe` tool to setup the game options as you want.  
This config tool has all the inner options of the game, plus some custom ones related to the arcade way of playing it.  
<br>
Choosing `SINGLE PLAYER` in the `Input Type` option, will make the game playable with either a mouse or a lightgun but there will be no P2 gun controls.  
Choosing `MULTIPLAYER` in the `Input Type` option, will enable P2 controls but DemulShooter will have to be used. Single mouse won't work.  
<br>
## Play
Use the following keyboard keys to play the game :  
`1`	-	P1 Start  
`2`	-	P2 Start  
`5` - 	Coins   
<br>
Then either use the mouse/lightgun only or DemulShooter, according to your controls settings in the config tool.  
<br>
## Known issues  
- The game may crash the first time it is run after a change in the resolution/screemode setting. Usually, after this first and only crash, the game is running fine with updated graphics.
